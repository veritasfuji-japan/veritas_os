THIRD-PARTY NOTICES

Last updated: 2026-02-22

This file documents third-party license obligations for distributed VERITAS
artifacts. It is based on dependency manifests currently committed in this
repository. Downstream redistributors remain responsible for validating the
final dependency set in built artifacts.

Security / compliance warning:
- If this notice file is stale relative to lockfiles or build outputs,
  redistribution may violate attribution or notice requirements.
- Treat updates to dependency manifests as a trigger to review this file.

1) Python dependencies (runtime + tooling)
Source manifest: `veritas_os/requirements.txt`

Representative dependencies declared in the manifest include:
- fastapi
- uvicorn
- pydantic
- requests
- numpy
- scipy
- faiss-cpu
- sentence-transformers
- opencv-python
- pytest
- pytest-cov

Note:
- Exact transitive dependency versions and licenses depend on resolver output.
- Before release, generate a full dependency report from the locked environment
  and append package name, version, license, copyright, and source URL.

2) JavaScript / TypeScript dependencies
Source manifests:
- `package.json` (workspace root)
- `frontend/package.json`
- `packages/design-system/package.json`
- `packages/types/package.json`

Representative dependencies declared in manifests include:
- next
- react
- react-dom
- tailwindcss
- class-variance-authority
- clsx
- tailwind-merge
- @playwright/test
- vitest
- @testing-library/react
- typescript

Note:
- Exact resolved versions and transitive dependency licenses are determined by
  `pnpm-lock.yaml` at build time.
- Before release, produce a lockfile-based notice report and include license
  texts where required.

3) Container and OS package obligations
Potential additional obligations may arise from:
- `Dockerfile` base image license terms
- Installed OS packages in container layers

Before release:
- Record base image digest and license terms.
- Export package list from image layers and merge applicable notices.

4) Maintainer checklist (release gate)
- [ ] Regenerate dependency inventory from lockfiles / pinned environments.
- [ ] Verify each dependency license compatibility with distribution model.
- [ ] Include required attribution texts in distributed artifacts.
- [ ] Re-check trademark usage against `TRADEMARKS`.
