PROPRIETARY LICENSE NOTICE FOR VERITAS OS REPOSITORY
====================================================

Copyright (c) 2025 Takeshi Fujishita. All Rights Reserved.

This repository contains multiple software components, documentation, and
related assets. Unless otherwise explicitly stated in a subdirectory-specific
LICENSE file, all contents of this repository are provided on an
“ALL RIGHTS RESERVED” basis.

By accessing, cloning, or downloading this repository, you acknowledge and
agree to the following terms.


1. SCOPE
--------

1.1. Core Code

Unless a different license is clearly indicated in a specific directory
or file, all source code under (including but not limited to):

    - veritas_os/
    - scripts/
    - tools/          (unless otherwise noted)
    - config/         (unless otherwise noted)
    - tests/          (unless otherwise noted)

is proprietary software and is NOT licensed for public use, copying,
modification, distribution, or sublicensing without the prior written
permission of the copyright holder.

Such code is provided for review, evaluation, and archival purposes only,
unless a separate written agreement grants you additional rights.


1.2. Open-Source / Publicly Licensed Components

Certain parts of this repository (for example, documentation,
research papers, or example scripts) MAY be released under open-source
licenses such as the Apache License, Version 2.0.

These components are explicitly marked by a LICENSE file placed inside
the corresponding subdirectory, for example:

    - docs/LICENSE
    - examples/LICENSE
    - other-subdir/LICENSE

If a subdirectory contains its own LICENSE file, the terms in that file
govern ONLY the contents of that subdirectory, and do NOT automatically
apply to the entire repository.


2. RIGHTS RESERVED
------------------

2.1. Default Rule

Except where a different license is explicitly provided in a
subdirectory-specific LICENSE file, the following applies:

    - You may NOT copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,
      or sell copies of the proprietary parts of this software.
    - You may NOT use the proprietary code to create derivative works
      without explicit written permission.
    - You may NOT remove or alter any copyright, trademark, or other
      proprietary notices.

Any use beyond what is permitted by applicable law (such as fair use or
mandatory statutory rights) requires prior written consent from the
copyright holder.


2.2. No Implied License

The presence of publicly viewable source code in this repository does NOT
imply any grant of license or rights. No license is granted by estoppel,
implication, or otherwise, except as expressly set forth in:

    - this top-level LICENSE, and
    - any subdirectory-specific LICENSE files.


3. OPEN-SOURCE LICENSE REFERENCES
---------------------------------

Where Apache License Version 2.0 or another open-source license is used,
the full license text is provided in the relevant subdirectory LICENSE file
(e.g., `docs/LICENSE`, `examples/LICENSE`).

For the avoidance of doubt:

    - The existence of an Apache-2.0 LICENSE in `docs/` means that the
      documentation in `docs/` is licensed under Apache-2.0.
    - It does NOT mean that `veritas_os/` or other core code is licensed
      under Apache-2.0, unless explicitly and clearly stated.

THE SOFTWARE AND OTHER CONTENTS OF THIS REPOSITORY ARE PROVIDED "AS IS",
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR

CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,
TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE
SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE OR RELATED
CONTENTS.
