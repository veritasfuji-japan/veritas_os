VERITAS Core Proprietary License (EULA)
Version 1.0 - Effective 2026-02-22

Copyright (c) 2025 Takeshi Fujishita and VERITAS contributors.
All rights reserved.

IMPORTANT: This repository is a multi-license repository. The default license
for all files is this proprietary EULA unless another directory-specific
LICENSE file explicitly applies.

1. Definitions

"Core" means proprietary VERITAS software and assets, including but not limited
to decision logic, Planner, Kernel, FUJI Gate, TrustLog, core pipelines,
internal policy engines, and any source files not covered by an explicit open
license in this repository.

"Evaluation Use" means non-production internal testing for technical
assessment, security review, or compatibility review.

"Commercial Use" means any direct or indirect revenue-generating or
production/business use, including SaaS, internal production systems, or
customer-facing operations.

"Managed Service" means hosting, operating, or providing all or a substantial
portion of Core functionality as a service for third parties.

2. License Grant

Subject to your compliance with this EULA, Licensor grants you a limited,
non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to:
(a) access and use Core for Evaluation Use; and
(b) make reasonable internal copies strictly for Evaluation Use.

No right is granted for Commercial Use except under a separate written
commercial agreement with Licensor.

3. Restrictions

You must not, and must not permit others to:

(a) use Core for Commercial Use without a separate written agreement;
(b) offer Core, or substantially similar functionality, as a Managed Service;
(c) circumvent, disable, or bypass license keys, metering, access controls,
    usage limitations, or other technical protection mechanisms;
(d) remove, alter, or obscure copyright, attribution, trademark, patent,
    or proprietary notices;
(e) redistribute, sublicense, sell, lease, or transfer Core;
(f) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble Core except where mandatory
    law expressly prohibits such restriction;
(g) create or distribute derivative works of Core except as expressly
    authorized in writing by Licensor;
(h) use Core to build, train, validate, or benchmark a competing product or
    service that reproduces Core decision logic.

4. Ownership

Core is licensed, not sold. Licensor and its licensors retain all right,
title, and interest in and to Core, including all intellectual property rights.

5. Open Components in this Repository

Certain directories are provided under separate open licenses (for example MIT)
that apply only to those directories. Those licenses do not apply to Core.
See README.md and directory LICENSE files for scope.

6. Compliance and Audit Cooperation

Upon reasonable written request, you will provide information sufficient to
confirm compliance with this EULA for material uses of Core.

7. Term and Termination

This EULA continues until terminated. It terminates automatically if you
breach any term. Upon termination, you must stop all use and destroy copies of
Core in your control, except where retention is required by law.

8. Disclaimer of Warranties

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, CORE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS
AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

9. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LICENSOR WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES,
OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, GOODWILL, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION,
ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO CORE OR THIS EULA. LICENSOR'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY
WILL NOT EXCEED USD 100.

10. Governing Law

This EULA is governed by applicable law designated by Licensor's principal
place of business, excluding conflict of law principles.
